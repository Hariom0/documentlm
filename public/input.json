  "summary": "This unit covers essential tools and practices for web programming, focusing on version control with Git, code editing, and web debugging. Git, a distributed version control system, is introduced with its features, commands, and workflow options. The comparison between Git and GitHub is discussed, highlighting the benefits of each. The study notes also cover code editors like VS Code, emphasizing features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and built-in debugging. Git cloning and command-line operations, including pull, push, stage, branch, and merge, are explained. Additionally, web debugging tools and browser developer tools are explored for identifying and fixing issues in web applications.",
